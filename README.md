# CodeAlpha_Task_Automation_Using_Python_Script
File Organizer Script
I created this Python script that automatically organizes files by moving all .jpg images from the Downloads folder to a dedicated JPG_Files folder inside the Pictures directory.
# Key Features:-
Scans the source folder for .jpg files
Creates the destination folder automatically if it does not exist
Moves all .jpg files safely using shutil.move()
Prints a success message after completion
# Core Concepts
Python file handling (os and shutil modules)
Working with file paths (os.path.join)
Conditional checks (if statements)
Automating repetitive tasks
Writing clean and reusable code
